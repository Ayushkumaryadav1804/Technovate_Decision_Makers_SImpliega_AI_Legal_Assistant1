Welcome to the Rental Agreement Generator
----------------------------------

Thank you for using our web application for creating rental agreements. Here's how our system works:

1. *Create a Rental Agreement*:
   - You can start by providing the necessary details for your rental agreement, such as tenant and landlord information, rent amount, and lease duration.
   - Our system will use this information to construct a comprehensive rental agreement.

2. *Chatbot Assistance*:
   - If you have any questions or need guidance during the process, feel free to use our built-in chatbot.
   - The chatbot is powered by GPT-2 and can provide helpful explanations and answers to common queries.

3. *Text Summarization*:
   - Once your rental agreement is generated, you have the option to summarize it.
   - This feature helps you quickly review the key points of the agreement without reading the entire document.

4. *Finalizing Your Agreement*:
   - After reviewing and customizing your agreement, you can download it in various formats, such as PDF or Word, for your records.

5. *Important Note*:
   - While our system can assist in generating rental agreements, we recommend consulting legal professionals for any specific legal advice or concerns.

We hope you find our rental agreement generator useful and user-friendly. If you have any feedback or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Thank you for choosing our service!
